description: "Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms is a breathtaking fantasy drama about an immortal girl from the mythical Iorph clan, destined to live forever without love or sorrow. When her secluded world is shattered by war, Maquia rescues an orphaned human baby and chooses to raise him as her ownâ€”defying fate as she experiences the fleeting beauty and heartbreak of motherhood. As her son grows older, their bond is tested by time, mortality, and the harsh realities of a world torn apart. With stunning visuals and a deeply emotional score, this poignant tale explores love, sacrifice, and what it means to truly live. A directorial debut by Mari Okada, celebrated for her powerful storytelling."
