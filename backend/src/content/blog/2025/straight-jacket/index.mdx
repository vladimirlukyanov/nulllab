Straight Jacket is a dark fantasy OVA that blends steampunk aesthetics with supernatural horror, delivering a gritty and action-packed experience. Based on the light novel by Ichirō Sakaki (Scrapped Princess, Chaos;HEAd), this 2007 anime adaptation is a short but intense ride into a world where magic and technology collide—with deadly consequences.

## Story & Setting

The series is set in an alternate world where magic exists but is highly regulated due to its dangerous side effects. Prolonged use of magic causes humans to mutate into grotesque monsters known as "Demons." To combat this, the government employs "Tactical Magicians," who wear special containment suits called Straight Jackets to suppress demonic transformation while wielding powerful spells.

The protagonist, Leiot Steinberg, is one such magician, working as a detective to investigate magical crimes. Alongside his young partner, Mare Schumacher, Leiot uncovers a conspiracy involving rogue mages, government corruption, and the terrifying consequences of unchecked magical power.

The plot is fast-paced, packing political intrigue, body horror, and brutal action into its three-episode runtime. While the story could benefit from more development (a common issue with short OVAs), it effectively establishes a compelling world and leaves viewers wanting more.

## Characters

* **Leiot Steinberg** – A cynical yet skilled magician with a tragic past. His dry wit and no-nonsense attitude make him a compelling lead.
* **Mare Schumacher** – A young girl with a mysterious connection to magic. Her innocence contrasts with the dark world around her.
* **Ralph Heartnet** – A rival magician with his own agenda, adding tension to the narrative.
The characters are intriguing, though the short runtime limits deep exploration of their backstories. Still, their interactions and moral dilemmas keep the story engaging.

## Animation & Style

Produced by Feel (OreGairu, Hajimete no Gal), Straight Jacket features detailed character designs and fluid action sequences. The steampunk aesthetic is well-realized, with mechanical suits, grimy cityscapes, and grotesque monster designs enhancing the dark tone. The animation holds up well, particularly in the visceral magical battles.

## Themes & Tone

The series explores themes of power, corruption, and the cost of using magic. The body horror elements—humans mutating into demons—add a disturbing layer to the worldbuilding. The tone is bleak but balanced with moments of dark humor and camaraderie.

## Final Verdict

Straight Jacket is a hidden gem for fans of dark fantasy and steampunk action. While its short length leaves some narrative threads underdeveloped, it succeeds in creating a fascinating world with intense action and a gripping atmosphere. If you enjoy shows like Darker than Black or Witch Hunter Robin, this OVA is worth checking out.
