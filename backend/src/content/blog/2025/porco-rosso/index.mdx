Soaring above the Adriatic Sea, he clashes with sky pirates while grappling with his haunted past and the secret behind his curse. The plot also delves into Fio's dreams of becoming an aircraft designer and the sky pirates' schemes to defeat Porco. Central to the story is the fiery rivalry between Porco Rosso and the charismatic but arrogant Donald Curtis."
