description: "Howl's Moving Castle is a enchanting fantasy film from Studio Ghibli that follows Sophie, a young hat-maker cursed into an old woman's body by a jealous witch. Seeking to break the spell, she befriends the mysterious wizard Howl and his sentient, steam-powered castle. Amidst soaring airships and magical battles, Sophie uncovers Howl’s secrets—and her own hidden strength—in a war-torn world where love and courage defy fate."
